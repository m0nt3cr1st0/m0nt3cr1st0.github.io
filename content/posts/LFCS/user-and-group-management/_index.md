# Foreword

The aim of this guide is to provide the quickest path possible towards passing the LFCS exam.
The way you are evaluated in this exam is based on practical exercises, so that's where I put the
focus on with these guides.

If you are a newcomer to Linux, I beg you to not stop here, Operating Systems is an amazing subject.
Its history is full of bright engineers who came up with clever solutions that you use on your day to day life. Take a full dive on other articles about the concepts these commands use here.
