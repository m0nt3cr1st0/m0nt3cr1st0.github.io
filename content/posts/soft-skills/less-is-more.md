# What makes a good engineer from a bad engineer?

The problem with nowadays life-style is that things go way faster than our brain can process.
There's so much information and products to be consumed that is hard to filter information out.

The CS legends I admire didn't have that problem (did they?). Instead their skill set was way more
limited, but extrely more sharped. Did Richtie and Thompson know X different technologies? probably not. On the other hand, they had extremely good foundation of computing problems.

From a Bloom's taxonomy perspective, that's where I want to be. I don't want to understand or 
remember all the new shinny technology some big company is developing and their marketing departments are trying to sell me.

I don't recall who I heared this quote from, but I think it clearly illustrates the problem:
> Current generations of computer scientists have a ton of solutions, and they are just looking for a problem to solve.

Focus of the basics:
* Modeling
* CS Fundamentals (OS, Network, SWE)
* Sketch
* Writing good documentation

All these subjects force you to create, evaluate and analyze knowledge, rather than just applying it and understanding it.

Ask yourself:
* Why this technology works as it does?
* Has this been invented before?
* Is there any cuantative analysis to support these statements?
