# Why makes it so amazing for CS

CS is by definition applicable! 

* Do you want to learn about ACLs? Implement one!
* Do you want to see how SELINUX feels? You can experiment with it!

# Others

What happens with other theories then?

* Vivid memories
* Mental palaces?
* Active recalling 
* Spaced repetition?
