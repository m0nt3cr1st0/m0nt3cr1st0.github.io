Notes about the science behind remembering and knowledge acquisition

# Many sides of the same coin

For a long time, remembering everything I read/learned was an obsession for me. At the same time, I had clear
that I didn't want to become the flashcards guy. So I needed to understand how the system worked, take a look at the
source code to find a way in.

It was only until I read "Remember" that I understood that almost all the information around about memorization is based
under the same principles. Although, sometimes these principles are wrapped around marketing to make it look like a genuine new system.

Thomas Frank, Justing Sung, Scott Young these guys are average Joes like anyone else. Still they felt confident enough to share tips and
frameworks on how to approach studying and memorization. Of course they make a living on that, so I had to found some more...neutral ground.

While messing around with Goodreads (due different matters), I found "Remember: The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting" by Dr Lisa Genova. She has a PhD on neuroscience from Harvard university, so I would say that's enough neutral and science-based for me.

Of course, like any other self-help book I didn't read page by page, but what I learned from the basic ideas of the book shocked me. Basically, all the learning-related content that I have seen so far was in one way or another re-iterating over those same principles:

* When learning new information, it is key to be 100% focused
* Multitasking kills your ability to learn new stuff, your brain needs to consolidate knowledge after processing it
* We consume way more information than we process -> STOP CHASING THE NEW SHYNY THING EVERY WEEK
* The more impressive the knowledge it is presented, the more likely it is that you will remember it.
* Part of studying something is trying to recall the content
* Self-test is another subtle way to tell your subconscious mind that the learned information is important
* All kinds of memory (specially muscle memory) require some repetition in order to consolidate that knowledge
